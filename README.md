Once you’ve signed in, you’ll create a new repository to get started.
On the new repository screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website.

Your website’s files will live in a repository named username.github.io (where “username” is your actual GitHub user name). To begin setting up your site, you have to open the Settings tab 
If you scroll down on the settings page, you’ll see the GitHub Pages section near the bottom. Click the Choose a theme button to start the process of creating your site.
GitHub does all the work to direct visitors to username.github.io to view your new website. you can open a new tab in your browser to go to your site!
One of the first things you can do is remove the default title of your index page, and add a friendlier message to it. Since this is a very quick change – and your first one – you’re going to make it on the default branch: main.i use jekyll theme and code there.

View the _config.yml file by navigating to it in the Code tab. You can edit the file by clicking on the pencil icon.
Currently your site has no set title, so we’re falling back to the name of the repo. To change this, I’m going to add the line “title: Welcome!” to this file. Feel free to do the same, except for your own username.

Under this title, you can add a message about the purpose of the page and describe what you want people to do while they’re here.
or you can drop your ready files in your repository and refesh it or you can change them in prose.io site.
